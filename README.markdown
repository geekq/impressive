Motivation for the _impress!ve_ fork
====================================

Macs have the perfect presentation software: while an external beamer
shows the slide you are talking about, your notebooks shows

* the current slide
* the next slide
* time elapsed for the current slide
* total elapsed time

This is **exactly** what I need and what _impressive_ is unfortunately
missing - the dual monitor feature.

_impressive_ is written in python and the source code seems to be 
a perfect foundation:

* the code looks clean
* it is a bit C style, not object oriented - a lot of global, 
  not (deeper) structured variables
