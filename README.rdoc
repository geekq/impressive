Presentations for geeks
=======================
Recently I've discovered a great presentation tool chain
for real geeks:

* beamer latex class to describe the slides in latex
* vim for editing
* [impressive][] (former keyJnote) by [keyJ][] for displaying

There two points for improvement in this chain.


Markdown plus latex
-------------------

A pure latex file demands too much markup for my taste, the same way
an html file needs too much markup. I am going to use something like
markdown with latex fragments the same way you can use html in markdown
as fallback in case you need something special


Motivation for the _impressive_ fork
------------------------------------

Macs have the perfect presentation software: while an external beamer
shows the slide you are talking about, your notebooks shows

* the current slide
* the next slide
* time elapsed for the current slide
* total elapsed time

This is **exactly** what I need and what _impressive_ is unfortunately
missing - the dual monitor feature.

_impressive_ source code seems to be a perfect foundation:
* the code looks clean
* it is a bit C style, not object oriented - a lot of global, 
  not (deeper) structured variables
